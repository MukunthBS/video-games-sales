# video-games-sales

## Goals of this project
Using <i>visualization methods</i> and
<i>machine learning models</i> can greatly help in making better
decisions in the direction in which the video game needs to be
developed and output a good game. Poor decisions and planning
not only harm the sales of the company that quarter but also the
reputation leading to future losses. Visualization methods help in
seeing what made a game succeed in the past and machine
learning models help us predict what decisions help in future
games and can be taken.

In this research project, we aim to find
<i><b>suitable visualizations to find past trends</i></b> and learn valuable
information unavailable from raw tabulated data along with
employing efficient and effective visualization methods as to
which aspects of the video game market are most profitable.
